# Dos-Attack-ON-Dns-Server-using-ip-Spoofing-


Here I implement Dos attack on Dns server (using ip spoofing) . For this attack I need
three machines. One machine works as Dns server and others are the attacker machine
and the normal user machine .Then From the attacker machine I execute a c code
which performs a query flood attack to our DNS server . This dos attack affects our DNS
server.DNS server stops to receive requests .So normal user canâ€™t visit there requested
page because the ip address of their requested page can't be translated.
